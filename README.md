Learning C++
============

I just started learning C++ so I decided to create a repository that will be mine go-to place for learning C++. I'm going to be putting all of my source code in this repository, plus links to some referencing materials that I found on the Internet.

If you're a starter like me, you're welcome to use this repository in any way you like.

## Current list of projects (by the creation order)

* helloworld
* helloworld2
* get_input
* mup_board

## Reference materials

* [Google for Education: C++ Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/)
