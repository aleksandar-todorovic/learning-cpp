Learning C++
============

I just started learning C++ so I decided to create a repository that will be mine go-to place for learning C++. I'm going to be putting all of my source code in this repository, plus links to some referencing materials that I found on the Internet.

If you're a starter like me, you're welcome to use this repository in any way you like.

## Current list of projects (by the creation order)

* **helloworld** - A Hello World program.
* **helloworld2** - Hello World in a 4x6 grid.
* **get_input** - A simple program with input.
* **mup_board** - Print multiplication board.
* **guessing_game** - A simple "guess the number" game.
* **eucl_alg** - An implementation of [Euclidean Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

## Reference materials

* [Google for Education: C++ Course](https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/)
